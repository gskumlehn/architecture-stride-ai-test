      "Threat Type": "Spoofing",
      "Scenario": "A malicious actor forges the IP address or TLS certificate of one of the internal services (e.g., the 'Order Service' or object storage service) to impersonate a legitimate entity and trick the API (FastAPI) into processing fake requests.",

    {
      "Threat Type": "Spoofing",

    {
      "Threat Type": "Tampering",

    {
      "Threat Type": "Repudiation",
      "Scenario": "A legitimate user or an internal service denies having performed a specific action (e.g., creating an order) because the application does not maintain robust audit logs or digital signatures that can prove the request's origin.",

    },
    {
      "Threat Type": "Repudiation",
      "Scenario": "A system administrator makes a critical change to data in 'Object Storage' and denies the action, as system logs do not capture the exact identity and action performed by the elevated user.",

      "Threat Type": "Information Disclosure",

      "Threat Type": "Information Disclosure",
      "Scenario": "Communication between the API (FastAPI) and backend services ('Order Service', 'Object Storage') does not use strong encryption at all points (despite mTLS and TLS being indicated), allowing an attacker on the internal or external network to intercept sensitive data in transit.",

      "Threat Type": "Information Disclosure",

    {
      "Threat Type": "Elevation of Privilege",
      "Scenario": "An attacker compromises the 'Order Service' by exploiting a vulnerability and then uses the obtained privileges to access other internal services or databases, such as 'Object Storage' or 'Redis Cache', using the implicit trust between services.",

    },
    {
      "Threat Type": "Elevation of Privilege",
      "Scenario": "The application uses the same service account or shared credentials for the API and the 'Order Service', allowing an attacker who compromises one service to have automatic and unrestricted access to all others.",

    "Implement strong authentication and role-based access control (RBAC) in the API (FastAPI) for all endpoints, ensuring that only authorized users and services can perform specific actions.",
    "Enforce the use of mTLS between all internal services ('API' to 'Order Service', 'API' to 'Object Storage'), ensuring that communication between them is mutually authenticated and encrypted.",
    "Add a robust logging and auditing system that records all critical actions and transactions, with timestamps and user identifiers, to enable traceability and accountability.",
    "Perform rigorous validation and sanitization of all user inputs in the API (FastAPI) to prevent injection attacks such as SQL Injection and Command Injection.",
    "Implement a WAF (Web Application Firewall) to protect the API against DDoS attacks, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and other common web application vulnerabilities.",
    "Use a centralized secret manager (e.g., Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) to store sensitive credentials and API keys, eliminating the need to hardcode them in configuration files or the source code.",
    "Configure the 'Order Service' and 'API' with the principle of least privilege, ensuring that each service has only the necessary permissions to perform its designated functions, without excessive privileges."
